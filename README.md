# What is DxDFC Reader?

<img src="assets/content/pdf-novel.png">

This is a script written in Python to generate light novel reading files made by fansubs of light novel [High School DxD](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_DxD)

The project was created as a pure hobby and also because I'm studying [data engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering), I'm a big fan of the work so that was my main motivation

I intend to increase the number of fansubs in the project and also add other languages

# Dependencies
